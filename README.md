ARTI 308: Machine Learning - Lab 2
1. Problem Statement
This project focuses on a Classification machine learning problem. The goal is to predict customer behavior—specifically, whether a customer will leave the service (Churn) or stay, based on their usage patterns and account information.

2. Dataset Description

Name: Telco Customer Churn Dataset.


Format: Tabular CSV file.


Target Variable: Churn (Categorical: Yes/No).


Features: Includes demographics (gender, senior citizen), account info (tenure, contract type), and usage metrics (monthly charges).

3. Methodology Overview
The project follows a structured machine learning workflow as illustrated in the methodology diagram:


Data Collection & Loading: Importing the dataset using the Pandas library in Python.


Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the raw data for analysis.


Model Selection & Training: Choosing suitable classification algorithms.


Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy and precision.

4. Repository Contents

Lab2_Data_Exploration.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing data loading and initial inspection.
