Dataset Name: Telco Customer Churn

Problem Type: Classification

Target Variable: Churn (Yes/No)

Problem Description: The goal of this project is to analyze customer behavior in a telecommunications company to predict whether a customer will leave the service (churn) or stay. By using historical data such as contract type, monthly charges, and tenure, we aim to build a classification model that identifies customers at risk of churning, allowing the company to take proactive retention measures.
